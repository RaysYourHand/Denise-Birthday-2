    <p class="words">Hello, how do you think about this? Is it good enough to forgive me? I really feel sorry and guilty though you said it's alright<br>
    I sincerely apologize for making you disapointed, and you don't need to hide your feelings too if you really feel something. <br>
    I thought it's the real love that we can both express thoughts and feelings to each other. tbh, I would rather you blame at me. <br>
    I will feel better. Anyways, it's four day later, and it's also "four" you! Hope you enjoyed it! <br><br>
    It's really been a long time since we met, I admitted that I thought you forgot me, were leaving. Being sad, I even had<br>
    no efforts to do this. On 4/17, your messages really cheer me up, not only this but other stuff makes me in a hard time then. <br>
    You again like before saved me when I am feeling not well, said n*times, I really appreciate and it's so lucky to meet you in my life <br>
    Although it's not your birthday today, I still hope that you could enjoy this as well as your birthday month, I gradually started <br>
    to know what's a "busy" like, I have three competitions to prepare, mid term exam to attend, a big test to take. <br>
    Thus, I hope you are not as busy as I do, it's not what I can decide though. Same, don't tear yourself down, take<br>
    more time to rest! And don't forget that I really love you. I thought you almost every day, or at least every two days! <br>
    It's the best thing in my life to meet you. It's the second year we are together! And our relationship is deeper too! <br>
    I hope one day, maybe soon, I can take my courge to talk English and to talk with you! <br> I hope you can be healty and happy!
    Remember that every thing you have done is good to me. I don't know if you feel that, <br> but if you once think you are doing bad, don't be
    stingy to share it with me, I am always by your side!<br> And I hope I can know more things about you, just like what you do. Share even the smallest
    thing in your life with me. <br> Even a good morning made my day. Happy Birthday! Wish we both get better, wish all the birthday <br> we will have could we pass with each other together! 
    <br> Always remeber I love you and miss you. Remember no matter how and what I am always with you!
